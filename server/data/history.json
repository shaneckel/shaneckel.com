Using machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence to create an interface that promotes exploration of all the groundbreaking work and research being done by the students and faculty. Moved our infrastructure to Google Cloud from our on premise, developed and associated a graphQL endpoint of our campus's data points ranging from courses, directory, and research papers. Using semantic analysis to categorize course description and research areas to allow users to narrow in on the wide range of complexity that CMU's CS school explores. Opened up the opportunity of working towards a dialogue system that seamlessly explores complex subjects while being fueled by real courses, research, faculty members, and academic papers that defined the technology the user was interested in.
